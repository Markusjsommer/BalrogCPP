# Bacterial Annotation by Learned Representation Of Genes (C++ version)

## Overview
Balrog is a prokaryotic gene finder based on a Temporal Convolutional Network. We took a data-driven approach to prokaryotic gene finding, relying on the large and diverse collection of already-sequenced genomes. By training a single, universal model of bacterial genes on protein sequences from many different species, we were able to match the sensitivity of current gene finders while reducing the overall number of gene predictions. Balrog does not need to be refit on any new genome.
